MDSpreadView Demo

Purpose
-------

MDSpreadView is a rewrite of `UIKit`'s `UITableView` that allows for the display 
of columns and column headers as well as rows. This repository serves to 
demonstrate and test the MDSectionedTableView class. Please visit the
[MDSpreadView](https://github.com/mochidev/MDSpreadView) repository for the 
actual code :)

Installation
------------

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mochidev/MDSpreadViewDemo
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

To include it into your projects either download the
[source](https://github.com/mochidev/MDSpreadView), or run the following
on your git repo:

```bash
$ cd <your_repo>
$ git submodule add git@github.com:mochidev/MDSpreadView.git <local_subpath>/MDSpreadView
```

This will allow you to update it at anytime by running `$ git submodule update`.

Usage
-----

Simply add the
[MDSpreadView](https://github.com/mochidev/MDSpreadView) submodule to
your project, add `#import "MDSpreadViewClasses.h"` to the top of the files you 
wish to use MDSpreadView in, and set the `delegate` and `datasource` properties 
of your `MDSpreadView` instance to one of your objects, much like you would do 
for a `UITableView`.

Then, implement the datasource and delegate methods demonstrated in `MDViewController.m`.

Notes
-----

 - An MDSpreadViewCell is created just like a UITableViewCell is -- try to 
 dequeue it from the spread view, otherwise create an autoreleased copy, then 
 configure and return.
 - The table headers are also made of cells, and are loaded just like 
 UITableViewCells are.
 - Works flawlessly with ~10000 cells on iPad 2/iPhone 4S, but you should use a 
 sane amount for older devices.
 - The bigger the cells, the faster it scrolls, since less are onscreen at a 
 time (especially on older hardware)

To Do
----

 - Row selection
 - Custom cell sizes
 - Column sorting
